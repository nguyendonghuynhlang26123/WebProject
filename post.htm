        Dried persimmons: The sun-kissed autumn treat of Da Lat.

          <p class="post-description">
            In the late 190s and early 1990s, several years before the Central
            Highlands city of Da Lat became one of Vietnam’s biggest tourism
            draws, nearly every local household in the city proudly grew
            persimmon trees.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though barely taken care of by locals, the persimmon trees still
            manage to bear fruit each autumn, adding a tinge of orange to the
            hilly town’s rustic charm.
          </p>
          <p>
            About 30 or 40 years ago, Da Lat’s persimmon trees, neatly grown in
            front of newly built households, were one of the first things to
            catch visitors’ eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            For locals, the trees not only added a pop of color to their
            gardens, but also provided shade and delicious fruits.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Persimmon trees were a cultural entity that shaped the lifestyle of
            Da Lat residents,” said Nguyen Huu Tranh, author of 'Da Lat Nam Xua
            (Old Times of Da Lat),' a quintessential study of the highland city.
          </p>
          <p>
            It takes nearly a decade for a persimmon tree to mature, yet
            persimmons themselves are sold for a mere VND5,000-10,000
            (US$0.21-43) per kilogram.
          </p>
          <p>
            With each tree only capable of producing up to 100 kilograms per
            year, it is obvious most locals grew persimmons out of love for the
            fruit rather than financial return.

          <p>
            “The food culture, gardening culture, and the whole manneristic
            lifestyle of Da Lat people are essentialized in this variety of
            tree,” Tranh said.
          </p>

          <p><b>An ode to the fruit</b></p>

          <p>
            Dang Thi Thu Van, owner of a specialty persimmon shop on Le Van
            Street in Da Lat, has managed to earn a living off producing
            ‘crunchy’ persimmon – a version of the fruit that is&nbsp;cured to
            remove its unbearably acrid taste.
          </p>

          <p>Van’s curing process is relatively straightforward.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>
            She picks the fruit when it&nbsp;turns light yellow and leaves
            it&nbsp;in an air-tight bag for five days to break down its tannins
            -- the astringent organic compounds abundant in fresh-off-the-twig
            persimmon. These five days also give the persimmon time to ripen a
            bit more and achieve a crunchy texture.
          </p>

          <p>
            According to Van, persimmons left to fully ripen on the tree, as
            well as picked half-ripe persimmons that have been left in aerated
            spaces, develop a soft, custardy mouthfeel, yellow pericarp, and a
            sweet, juicy flavor.
          </p>

          <p>
            On top of that, the skin of the fruit turns a vivid shade of pink,
            hence its Vietnamese name 'trai hong'&nbsp;or 'pink fruit.'
          </p>

          <p>
            Van shared that growing up she often resorted&nbsp;to fully ripe
            persimmons during times when food was scarce.
          </p>

          <p>
            In Da Lat, persimmon harvest seasons begin&nbsp;in mid-September and
            end&nbsp;in late November or early December, just as the city’s
            rainy season is ending.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p>
            During this time, farms in Da Lat spend a great deal of time making
            dried persimmons by sun-drying pieces of the fruit before fully
            dehydrating them in a charcoal oven.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p>Each batch takes approximately five days to make.</p>

          <p>
            During Tet holiday – the Vietnamese Lunar New Year celebration –
            families in Da Lat often gather and tell stories over plates of
            dried persimmons and warm cups of tea.
          </p>

            </figure>
          </p>

          <p>Van’s children, who left their town to work in finance and banking, have all come back to take on the family business.</p>
          
          <p>Van and her daughter Lan Anh dry their persimmons at a processing facility deep inside a persimmon plantation in Da Lat’s Khe Sanh Valley.</p>

          <p>The fact that she has not sold the land despite the current local real estate boom coupled with the low profitability of persimmons is&nbsp;an ode to her appreciation for the fruit.</p>

          <p>The duo disapproves of the ‘industrialized’ way of dehydrating persimmons by using honeycomb charcoal as fuel in order to decrease the amount of time it takes to produce a batch, claiming that using wood charcoal and hot air produces a final product that is more tender and chewy.</p>
